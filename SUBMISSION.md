## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Component Structure

Describe your component hierarchy:

```
Example:
ScheduleView (main container)
├── DoctorSelector (doctor dropdown)
├── DayView (day calendar)
│   ├── TimeSlotRow
│   └── AppointmentCard
└── WeekView (week calendar)
    └── AppointmentCard (reused)
```

**Your structure:**
```
[Describe your component tree]
```

**Why did you structure it this way?**

[Explain your reasoning - what patterns did you use? Why?]
